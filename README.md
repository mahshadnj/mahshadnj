I am currently in my first semester of the Mechanical Engineering master’s program at Sharif University of Technology.
I got my Biomedical Engineering Bachelor's degree from Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic) 📚

I am passionate about applying my skills to programming projects at the intersection of biomechanics, robotics, and rehabilitation.

I welcome opportunities to connect with researchers and professionals in these fields. 😉

I'm interested in volleyball, several artworks such as watercolor paintings and making handicrafts. 🏐🎨🖼️
